# CryptoGUI
A little project including cryptanalysis and Java GUI!
<br>
<br>
I use this project as a way for me to learn Java GUI programming. Also diving into front-end development if I can!
<br>
(And it also helps me kill some time by practicing and improving my skills!)
<br>
<br>
Tasks (current, upcoming, planned, etc.):<br>
- [ ] Implement simple cryptographic techniques
  - [ x ] Caesar
  - [ x ] Vigen√®re
  - [ ] Porta
  - [ ] Zimmermann
  ...and more!
- [ ] Implement better user interface
  - [ ] Main menu
  - [ x ] Text screen
  - [ x ] Ensure buttons work
  ...and more!
- [ ] Thinking of other improvements like:
  - [ ] Import from/export to files
  - [ ] Including/ignoring special characters
  - [ x ] Design pattern implementation (Strategy for algorithm selection and Singleton for frame instances?)
  ...and more!
<br>
A very relaxed, recreational project. Looking forward to how this looks. More to come soon!
