# CryptoGUI [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jmpreyes/cryptogui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jmpreyes/cryptogui)
A little project with cryptography and Java GUI programming!
___
I use this project as a way for me to improve my skills and to learn new ones.<br>
*Inspiration: using my previous projects from school (undergrad and postgrad) and programming skills to make something cool!*<br>

**Tasks (current, upcoming, planned, things that come into mind, etc.)**

Cryptography:
- [x] Implement Caesar cipher
- [x] Implement Vigen√®re cipher
- [x] Implement Porta cipher
- [ ] Implement Zimmermann cipher
And more variations in the future!

User Interface (with Java Swing and AWT):
- [x] Implement menu for cipher selection
- [ ] Implement fluid transition between frames

Others:
- [ ] Importing from or exporting to files
- [ ] Including and/or ignoring special characters
- [x] Design pattern implementation (for practice too!)
- [ ] Adding descriptions for each cipher technique

**This is a very relaxed, recreational project.**
___
More to come soon!
