# CryptoGUI
A little project with cryptography and Java GUI!
___
I use this project as a way for me to learn Java GUI programming. Also diving into front-end development if I can!
(And it also helps me kill some time by practicing and improving my skills!)

Tasks (current, upcoming, planned, etc.):<br>
- [ ] Implement simple cryptographic techniques
  - [ x ] Caesar
  - [ x ] Vigenère
  - [ ] Porta
  - [ ] Zimmermann
  ...and more!
- [ ] Implement better user interface
  - [ ] Main menu
  - [ x ] Text screen
  - [ x ] Ensure buttons work
  ...and more!
- [ ] Thinking of other improvements like:
  - [ ] Import from/export to files
  - [ ] Including/ignoring special characters
  - [ x ] Design pattern implementation (Strategy for algorithm selection and Singleton for frame instances?)
  ...and more!

**This is a very relaxed, recreational project.**

So far, only Caesar cipher is implemented with the interface. Buttons and menu work.
A screenshot of application looks as follows:

Vigenère cipher also implemented but not tied to the interface. That's the next focus.

More to come soon!
